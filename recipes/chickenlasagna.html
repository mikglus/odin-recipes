    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Delicious lasagna with chicken</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>12 lasagna noodles, or as needed</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded cooked chicken, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can artichokes in water, drained</li>
      <li>8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>Â¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the
        boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to
        the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix chicken, artichokes, shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup Parmesan
        cheese, and sun-dried tomatoes together in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat cream cheese, milk, 1 tablespoon basil, and garlic powder together
        in a bowl until smooth. Mix 2/3 of the cream cheese mixture with the
        chicken mixture. Spread remaining cream cheese mixture into the bottom
        of a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread a single layer of lasagna noodles over the cream cheese mixture,
        top with 1/3 of the chicken mixture, and a layer of mozzarella cheese
        slices. Repeat layering with noodles, chicken mixture, and mozzarella
        slices 2 times. Top with remaining Parmesan cheese and basil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbling, about 25 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
